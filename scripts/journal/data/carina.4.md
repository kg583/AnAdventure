Being underground for this long can’t be healthy. I certainly seem to be in perfect physical health, but as we walk down cave after cave after cave… my mind becomes lost in the dark monotony. I miss the sun. I miss the sky. I miss my house and my bed and the sight of anything that isn’t stone or dirt or gravel.


And yet, I want to press on. Being down here, it’s like another dimension. The monsters down here are stronger than those that breach the surface, being trapped in eternal darkness. They live and they die, just as the animals and villagers above… and the two would never meet if not for us plucky adventurers. I have to wonder what’s even further down. We don’t even know how deep “further down” goes… there might not even be a bottom, only endless earth and darkness.
