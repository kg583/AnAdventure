Help me, Norma. Help me fix it….

I did all that they asked. I… offered… my magic… my potions… my knowledge. Everything, to them.

They… only wanted one thing: me, a Player… Vulpecula the Fool.


They took whatever it is that lets us come back. I… always wondered, always pondered what it was. But they found it. They found it… and imbued these… totems with its power. Power against Death herself. They are stronger than any of us can withstand alone.

And they won’t let me die. They keep me… on the edge of starvation. If I… dip too low,… the totem pulls me out. They say they need me. I don’t know for what anymore. Maybe this is fate paying my due.


Save me, Norma. Save me… somebody.

And if I’m finally freed of this… save yourself from the same.

The Illagers offer… nothing… nothing but pain and broken promises.
