Norma’s leaving tomorrow. We’ve been holed up in this village for weeks, and I get it… it’s damp and smelly and kinda exactly the opposite of where’d you want to live. I just… well, I feel like we’ve only scratched the surface of the knowledge to be uncovered here.


The swamps hold an innate to natural magics. The energy is potent and pure, so some ingredients grow here that we can’t find anywhere else. The villagers helped us collect them, and, well, I can’t wait to try out the new potions we can make with them… but then, when we were finishing up the other day, %(villager.cleric[0].name) the Cleric mentioned something I can’t stop thinking about.

They informed me there’s a Witch coven not far from here. A family of skilled magicians who reject the ways of most villagers. They live deep in the swamp, to better connect with those primal energies. I thought surely, surely Norma would want to meet them, or at least try, but she… she brushed it off without a thought!


She says they’re dangerous, unpredictable, and have nothing to offer us… and I think that’s a load of cocoa beans. Norma thinks she knows everything, and for so long I’ve thought so too. She’s been my teacher since I first awoke…. I want to keep learning from her, but….

I need to go my own way this time. If she won’t learn from the Witches, then I will. I know there’s danger, and it may take a while to gain their trust (or even converse with them), but I can’t just let this new bounty of magical knowledge pass me by.
