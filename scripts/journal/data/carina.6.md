Orion is gone. Not dead, no… I thought he was at first. He fell from a ledge, just a bit too far for his enchantments to save him, and I was sure our journey was over at long last. I would collect his items and return to the surface to meet him back at the village.

Except… something was wrong. His experience was missing, and his remains lay atop this strange, navy-colored moss. I built down and found myself here in this enormous cavern with an entire ruined city filling its chambers. That moss covers it from head to toe, in a single, great web.

It… it breathes, it pulses, it reacts… it can listen.


It heard Orion fall.

There were strange shrieks from the darkness, and a blindness fell over my eyes even in the torchlight. As I followed after him, they came again, with the same inescapable looming dread. Then I examined his body, trying to turn it towards me, and the third strike sounded.


Orion’s remains sunk into the ground, like they were eaten, and I heard… digging. Deafening and terrible… it came from a monster unlike anything I thought this world could host. A face with great horns and no eyes, arms like logs clawing their way out of the ground, a beating heart behind a ribcage of mossy bones….

I fled. I ran faster than I ever thought I could. I didn’t leave any time for the monster to show me its powers, but whatever they are, they are surely rooted in evil and blight. I’m safe for the moment, I hope. The sane part of me knows I should escape. Except… I know I’ll be leaving Orion behind, for good.

And if this is that presence that tug at me from below, I simply can’t leave it be, not yet. Perhaps I can understand it, conquer it,… save Orion and who knows who else has been claimed by the moss.

There’s a massive portal of some kind at the center of the city, surrounded by faint candlelight. It looks important. It may have the answers.


It must, or we’re all doomed to this disease.
