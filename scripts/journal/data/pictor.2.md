I’ve just returned from a hike in the plains. I don’t think anywhere else in the Overworld is so empty, and so tranquil. See, echoes don’t carry far out here; the snow likes to absorb sound, so even my leather boots crunching atop the powder are muted. It’s all just so… quiet. I’d almost call it spooky, but with the sun shining overhead and rabbits scurrying around the knolls, well… it’s a kind of paradise.

Oh, and speaking of animals, I saw a polar bear. Big mama bear I think, with a cub. She kept her distance and so did I, but she was beautiful. The villagers say they don’t like to stray far inland, so I must be pretty lucky. There were a few foxes scampering around near the edge of the forest, too.

If I could take trips like this everyday, I would, but there’s still the whole business of not starving to death to worry about. And I’d really not like to die out here; it’d be a real pain to get back to my grave. But even just today’s expedition has made the past week out here well worth it.

I should bring my friends here sometime. Carina would appreciate the scenery, I think. I could maybe convince Volans and Octans to sail up here to try out iceboating. I’m still pretty lousy at it but I bet they’d pick it up right away.
