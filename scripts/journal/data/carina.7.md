Whoever or whatever finds this, know that it is my last testament. I am trapped in this cursed city, with no food or blocks or hope left to aid me. The horrors that claimed Orion lie in wait for even a single sound to alert them to my hiding place. I will not escape.

You are strong, or maybe brave, or maybe foolish to have come here and find my remains. If you are stronger or braver or more foolish than I was… maybe you’ll make it out alive, and return to the surface with the knowledge of what you have seen here. Take mine with you, please.

The catalysts are the key. The moss grows from them, feeding off of experience. It will consume… everything… it touches, but it cannot spread further without a catalyst in reach. They hold the blight’s power and can keep it at bay, or perhaps even craft an antidote.
