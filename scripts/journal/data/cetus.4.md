Here lies the remains of Cetus the Coward.

I would not join my brothers on their folly into the monument, but now I shall join them in death all the same.


They promised me they would return within ten days, glorious spoils of conquest or otherwise. When that mark passed, I watched their beds, all day and all night, waiting for at least one of them to respawn… they never did. They simply vanished, and I fear the worst. These treasures are all I have left of them, but they cannot fill the void.

Nothing ever will.


I wish I knew why the world decided to take them. I wish I had the miniscule solace of knowing they are dead, and by some cruel design never coming back. I wish I could know they aren’t lost in distant lands, wandering in search of home.


I wish I could know that whatever befell them, they faced it together.


I’m ready for the world to take me too. I haven't seen another player in weeks, nor any traders or bandits. Something changed… something that made the world go quiet.

If someone does manage to find this, I hope the same fate does not loom over you. Perhaps these treasures from our adventures can aid you.

There is nothing left for me.
