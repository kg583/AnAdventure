This cave is… surreal. A garden of vines and moss and bushes, all thriving far beneath the surface. The water hear flows calmly, hosting all kinds of colorful fish.

And there is a creature I’ve never seen before swimming after them! It has great frills on its face like a cat’s whiskers; the rest of its body is pink and scaled. It’s playful, and so very curious about us. Orion enticed it to follow us around for a while, though it would be unkind to take it with us further down.

I’m not sure I want to leave. I mean, I *do* want to return to the surface eventually, but why keep going down? This is enough treasure for me, though I won’t ever succeed in convincing Orion to agree. He’s got his mind on the Lonely Miner’s treasure and nothing else, and he if swayed somewhere south of stubbornness I’d call the dedication admirable.

Hell, it got me on my feet and exploring this paradise of a cavern. I cannot thank him enough for that.
