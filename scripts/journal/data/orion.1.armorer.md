Carina has finally agreed to join me on my search for the Lonely Miner. It only took asking and begging over and over and over and over, but she came around. I knew she would. I mean, who wouldn’t want to find the riches of the first player!?!? They probably mined more gold and diamonds and who knows what else than I could ever dream.

I was going to set off right now, but Carina wasn’t having it, and, well, she’s right. I don’t mind dying as much as her, but stumbling my way through a cave without any preparations just feels sloppy. The Lonely Miner deserves far better than that.


(Maybe one death, though,  y’know? To feel like I’ve earned it.)


We’ll put together some respectable gear before heading down. %(villager.armorer[0].name) will set us up well. I can handle the monsters on the surface no sweat, but Corvus says they’ll give me a run for my money further down. He’s probably right, as much as I hate to admit it. He’s right about most things.
