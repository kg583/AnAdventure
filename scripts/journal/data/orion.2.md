Hey Diary, have I told you the story of the Lonely Miner?


“No, Orion, you haven’t. Please regale me with this fanciful tale. You look extra handsome today, by the way.”


Why thank you, Diary. Of course I am happy to tell it to you.

It begins long long ago. Before Norma, before Leo and Pyxis, before even Corvus arrived in the Overworld. Before the Villagers, before the Incursion, before even the City-Builders… there was the first player. They arrived here like the rest of us, but unlike the rest of us, they were all alone.
Just imagine that for a moment! No players, no villagers, no mobs, no friends, no enemies… nobody to talk to, or explore with, or love. But they persevered. They explored all across the world, delving into every dungeon, every ruin, perhaps even every biome! 


“This is a charming tale, Orion, as are your irresistible good-looks, but how do we know the Lonely Miner was real?”


Great question, Diary. See, one day, a long while ago, Leo and Pyxis were exploring a temple, the usual business… except it was already looted! They triple checked their maps: none of us had touched it, not even Cass’ little gang. So who got to it before them? Corvus didn’t know, and we all seem to agree he was the first to wake up… unless he wasn’t.

Then we tried to ask the Villagers about them. After some pantomime, they shared a tale with us… of the Lonely Miner. And this, dear Diary, is the tale we are going to uncover once and for all.
