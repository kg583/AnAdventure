The voyage to this land has proven more than worth the trouble. The island is pristine, no doubt thanks to its remoteness, but it’s more than that. I have spent most of my time studying the strange fungus which grows here. It forms dense networks all throughout the soil, turning it lavender in hue and slightly sticky to touch.


The local fauna have adapted in turn… cows with mushrooms growing out of their backs! This entire ecosystem is found nowhere else in the world, and by my experiments that’s probably a good thing: the mycelium networks grow extremely quickly, and can overtake grasses from the mainland in a matter of days. I suspect the entire world would turn purple if any were to find its way across the sea.

That said, the mushrooms make for excellent building material. I’ll be hunkering down here for a while, I think. There’s a change in the air… something is happening, something cold and quiet, and I don’t like the look of it. Corvus always called me superstitious, but I’m never wrong about these things.

I would warn him… if I could find him. I haven’t seen really anybody lately, and not just on account of how remote this island is. And I need to figure out exactly what it is that has my hairs on end.
