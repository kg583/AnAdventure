Man, it is _really_ cold here. I’m not surprised at all, what with all the snow and ice and houses made of snow and ice… but you can’t really understand what someone means when they say “the snow will freeze your toes off” until you experience it for yourself.


And… yeah, it’s really cold; that’s my verdict.
The villagers here do well to fend it off. They wear layered clothes and keep furnaces lit in their homes; the %(villagers.employed[0].profession)’s shop was frankly toasty when I stopped by. Farming is tough, and they’re able to keep a few plots, but animals are by far the better crop. Not to mention that a leg of mutton becomes the tastiest thing you’ve ever eaten after rowing on a frozen river for a few days.


I’ve got a nice little home to myself here; villager hospitality seems to be a universal virtue. I’m not sure how long I’ll stay, but I won’t be leaving any time soon. The nature here is… pristine. It’s incredible. I remember now something Corvus once said of the snow: that the Creators wanted to decorate their best work with silver-white diamonds, so that it may glisten in even the faintest light. I’m inclined to agree with him, staring out from this little hut.


And there are even greater wonders I have yet to explore!

Wide ranges of ice-capped mountains

Massive frozen oceans with icebergs sailing in their waters

Impossibly tall spikes of ice that stretch on like the sky…

Oh how I long to know them all.
