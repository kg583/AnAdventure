And so begins our underground escapades…. Orion and I have geared up: iron armor, extra pickaxes, stacks upon stacks of torches, and at least a week’s worth of baked potatoes. (Orion had planned to head down with just ten sticks, a crafting table, and what he called “determination”.)

We’ve scouted a ravine not too far from here; it runs deep, deep enough for monsters to appear in its crevices even in the day. But we will prevail over them, I’m sure of it.

And we’ll have to prevail, if I want Orion to ever shut up about the Lonely Miner. %(villager.any[0].name) is the one who first told him the tale, and now it seems to be the only thing on his mind. He’s sure he can find their spoils underground… whatever that may be. Honestly I’ve never paid attention to his many, many retellings.


I’m glad, though, that he finally swayed me. Even if it’s a fairytale, the simple thrill of expedition and adventure… I haven’t felt it since I first appeared in the world. Once Corvus and Vela got me settled… I was content. I got comfortable. I told myself I wasn’t the type to sojourn like Leo or Pyxis or Norma. But now, as I anticipate setting off, I’ve never been more excited.
