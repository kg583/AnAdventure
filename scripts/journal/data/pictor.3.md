I tremble as I write to you, diary. We were gathered at the center of the village, around a campfire as daylight was dying. I was conversing with the %(villagers.employed[-1].profession) over dinner, recounting tales of my adventures in the jungles. All was well…


Then there was a scream. Another villager, Cacelle, a fletcher; they must have been walking home, just out of torchlight. %(villagers.employed[-1].name) and I and the other villagers rushed to where we heard them, and… a zombie. Not sure how one slipped past the golem, especially before sunset, but one is all it takes. They let out another scream, and it looked like it was going to be their last.

And then they turned. The zombie’s bite… it made Cacelle into a zombie as well. I could only watch, too horrified to move. Their clothes had been torn, and their skin turned green and rough…. I didn’t notice the other villagers already fled; I was too transfixed on what Cacelle had become. Their eyes… it was like they were still inside, trying to peek back out, locked forever behind undeath. They groaned just like the zombie beside them, inching toward me in that same sort of stumbling lock-step.


I didn’t want to run, but I didn’t want to face them either. The zombie would be no trouble, but Cacelle…. I thought back to other zombies I had seen before that bore striking resemblance to villagers. I somehow never considered that they were turned. So afraid, so confused…

I was as frozen as the snow.


Out of the corner of my eye I saw the golem approaching. It tossed the zombie into the air, killing the monster before it could land.

Then it faced Cacelle with the same deadly intent. It either did not know or did not care who they once were. I tried to shout at it to stop, but the golems have never listened to players.


The sun fell beneath the horizon and Cacelle was dead. The other villagers were asleep in their beds. The golem was ambling down the road, waiting for another monster to show itself. And there I was, somehow the only one in the world mortified by the scene.
Must this be the villagers’ fate? To die to the undead, then be slain again by their former guardians? I cannot comprehend the pain and fear that must come with it. And if their mind survives… no, no this can’t be it.

There must be a way. There must be.


I could try to find Norma. She knows everything there is to know about magic and monsters… but nobody’s heard from her in months. Corvus might have some ideas too, but there’s no way he’d help. No… I’m the only one who can do this, who can save these villagers here and now. They don’t deserve this… torture. I need to experiment… to find a cure. Cacelle must be the last one. 

They _will_ be the last…
