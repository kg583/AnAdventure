Carina has finally agreed to join me on my search for the Lonely Miner. It only took asking and begging over and over and over and over, but she came around. I knew she would. I mean, who wouldn’t want to find the riches of the first player!?!? They probably mined more gold and diamonds and who knows what else than I could ever dream.

I was going to set off right now, but Carina wasn’t having it, and, well, she’s right. I don’t mind dying as much as her, but stumbling my way through a cave without any preparations just feels sloppy. The Lonely Miner deserves far better than that.


(Maybe one death, though,  y’know? To feel like I’ve earned it.)


We’ll prepare plenty of food before heading down. %(villagers.butcher[0].name) has the best cuts, and I’d very much like some meat in my belly while down in the depths. Carina’s a vegetarian by choice, so I’ll whip up some baked potatoes and stews for her. She’d eat a nice porkchop if it came to it, but I’m not gonna put her in that spot. She tolerates me enough as it is.

Though, if we up needing to scavenge, we’re probably not finding any plants down there. That’s… well that’s a bridge we’ll burn when we get there.
