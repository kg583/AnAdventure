	"journal.aa.cetus.4.1": "Here lies the remains of Cetus the Coward.\n\nI would not join my brothers on their folly into the monument, but now I shall join them in death all the same.",
	"journal.aa.cetus.4.2": "They promised me they would return within ten days, glorious spoils of conquest otherwise. When that mark passed, I watched their beds, all day and all night, waiting for at least one of them to respawn… they never did.",
	"journal.aa.cetus.4.3": "They simply vanished, and I fear the worst. These treasures are all I have left of them, but they cannot fill the void. Nothing ever will.",
	"journal.aa.cetus.4.4": "I wish I knew why the world decided to take them. I wish I had the miniscule solace of knowing they are dead, and by some cruel design never coming back.",
	"journal.aa.cetus.4.5": "I wish I could know they aren’t lost in distant lands, wandering in search of home. I wish I could know that whatever befell them, they faced it together.",
	"journal.aa.cetus.4.6": "I’m ready for the world to take me too. I haven't seen another player in weeks, nor any trader or bandits. Something changed… something that made the world go quiet.",
	"journal.aa.cetus.4.7": "If someone does manage to find this, I hope the same fate does not loom over you. Perhaps these treasures from our adventures can aid you.\n\nThere is nothing left for me.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.1.1": "Man, it is really cold here. I’m not really surprised, what with all the snow and ice and houses made of snow and ice… but being “so cold your toes might freeze off” is something you need to experience for yourself.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.1.2": "And… yeah, it’s really cold; that’s my verdict.\n\nThe villagers here do well to fend it off. They wear layered clothes and keep furnaces lit in their homes; the %s’s hut was frankly toasty when I stopped by.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.1.3": "Farming is tough, and they’re able to keep a few plots, but animals are by far the better crop. Not to mention that a leg of mutton becomes the tastiest thing you’ve ever eaten after rowing on a frozen river for a few days.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.1.4": "I’ve got a nice little home to myself here; villager hospitality seems to be a universal virtue. I’m not sure how long I’ll stay, but I won’t be leaving any time soon. The nature here is… pristine. It’s incredible.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.1.5": "I remember now something Corvus once said of the snow: that the Creators wanted to decorate their best work with shining, silver diamonds, so that it may glisten in even the faintest light.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.1.6": "I’m inclined to agree with him, staring out from this little hut. Whether calm and still, or carried in the wind, or tossed about by foxes playing on the hillside…\n\nAnd there are even greater wonders I have yet to explore!",
	"journal.aa.pictor.1.7": "Wide ranges of ice-capped mountains\n\nMassive frozen oceans with icebergs sailing in their waters\n\nImpossibly tall spikes of pure ice that stretch on the sky\n\nOh how I long to know them all.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.2.1": "I’ve just returned from a hike in the plains. I don’t think anywhere else in the Overworld is so empty, and so tranquil.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.2.2": "See, echoes don’t carry far out here; the snow likes to absorb sound, so even my leather boots crunching atop the powder are muted. It’s all just so… quiet.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.2.3": "I’d almost call it spooky, but with the sun shining overhead and rabbits scurrying around the knolls, well… it’s a kind of paradise.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.2.4": "Oh, and speaking of animals, I saw a polar bear. Big mama bear I think, with a cub. She kept her distance and so did I, but she was beautiful. The villagers say they don’t like to stray far inland, so I must be pretty lucky.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.2.5": "If I could take trips like this everyday, I would, but there’s still the whole business of not starving to death to worry about. And I’d really not like to die out here; it’d be a real pain to get back to my grave.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.2.6": "But even just today’s expedition has made the past week out here well worth it.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.2.7": "I should bring my friends here sometime. Carina would appreciate the scenery, I think. I could maybe convince Volans and Octans to sail up here to try out iceboating. I’m still pretty lousy at it but I bet they’d pick it up right away.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.3.1": "I tremble as I write to you, diary. We were gathered at the center of the village, around a campfire as daylight was dying. I was talking with the %s over dinner, recounting tales of my adventures in the jungles. All was well…",
	"journal.aa.pictor.3.2": "Then there was a scream. Another villager, Cacelle, a fletcher; they must have been walking home, just out of torchlight. %s and I and the other villagers rushed to where we heard them, and… a zombie.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.3.3": "Not sure how one slipped past the golem, especially before sunset, but one is all it takes. They let out another scream, and it looked like it was going to be their last.\n\nAnd then they turned.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.3.4": "The zombie’s bite… it made Cacelle into a zombie as well. I could only watch, too horrified to move. Their clothes had been torn, and their skin turned green and rough….",
	"journal.aa.pictor.3.5": "I didn’t notice the other villagers already fled; I was too transfixed on what Cacelle had become. Their eyes… it was like they were still inside, trying to peek back out, locked forever behind undeath.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.3.6": "They groaned just like the zombie beside them, inching toward me in that same sort of stumbling lock-step.\n\nI didn’t want to run, but I didn’t want to face them either. The zombie would be no trouble, but Cacelle….",
	"journal.aa.pictor.3.7": "I thought back to other zombies I had seen before that bore striking resemblance to villagers. I somehow never considered that they were turned. So afraid, so confused…\n\nI was as frozen as the snow.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.3.8": "Out of the corner of my eye I saw the golem approaching. It tossed the zombie into the air, killing the monster before it could land. Then it faced Cacelle with the same deadly intent.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.3.9": "It either did not know or did not care who they once were. I tried to shout at it to stop, but the golems have never listened to players. The sun fell beneath the horizon and Cacelle was dead.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.3.10": "The other villagers were asleep in their beds. The golem was ambling down the road, waiting for another monster to show itself.\n\nAnd there I was, somehow the only one in the world mortified by the scene.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.3.11": "Must this be the villagers’ fate? To die to the undead, then be slain again by their former guardians? I cannot comprehend the pain and fear that must come with it. And if their mind survives… no, no this can’t be it. There must be a way. There must be.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.3.12": "I could try to find Norma. She knows everything there is to know about magic and monsters… but nobody’s heard from her in months. Corvus might have some ideas too, but there’s no way he’d help.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.3.13": "No… I’m the only one who can do this, who can save these villagers here and now. They don’t deserve this… torture. I need to experiment… to find a cure.\n\nI'll go out into the wilderness, away from them all.",
	"journal.aa.pictor.3.14": "I can't have anybody else I care about getting hurt. Cacelle must be the last one.\n\n\nThey will be the last…",
